    fields: str
    """
    The `/received` route by default returns a limited set of fields, and allows
    customers to override the default field set by specifying individual fields. The
    reasons for this are: 1. Most customers require only a small subset of fields,
    but that subset varies from customer to customer; 2. Flat schema is much easier
    to work with downstream (importing into BigTable etc); 3. Performance (time to
    process, file size). If `?fields=` is not specified, default field set is
    returned. This default field set may change at any time. When `?fields=` is
    provided, each record is returned with the specified fields. `fields` must be
    specified as a comma separated list without any whitespaces, and all fields must
    exist. The order in which fields are specified does not matter, and the order of
    fields in the response is not specified.
    """

    sample: float
    """When `?sample=` is provided, a sample of matching records is returned.

    If `sample=0.1` then 10% of records will be returned. Sampling is random:
    repeated calls will not only return different records, but likely will also vary
    slightly in number of returned records. When `?count=` is also specified,
    `count` is applied to the number of returned records, not the sampled records.
    So, with `sample=0.05` and `count=7`, when there is a total of 100 records
    available, approximately five will be returned. When there are 1000 records,
    seven will be returned. When there are 10,000 records, seven will be returned.
