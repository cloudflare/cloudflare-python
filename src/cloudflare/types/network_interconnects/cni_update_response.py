    Note that _this is not a security measure_. MD5 is not a valid security
    mechanism, and the key is not treated as a secret value. This is _only_
    supported for preventing misconfiguration, not for defending against malicious
    attacks.

    The MD5 key, if set, must be of non-zero length and consist only of the
    following types of character:

    - ASCII alphanumerics: `[a-zA-Z0-9]`
    - Special characters in the set `'!@#$%^&*()+[]{}<>/.,;:_-~`= \\||`

    In other words, MD5 keys may contain any printable ASCII character aside from
    newline (0x0A), quotation mark (`"`), vertical tab (0x0B), carriage return
    (0x0D), tab (0x09), form feed (0x0C), and the question mark (`?`). Requests
    specifying an MD5 key with one or more of these disallowed characters will be
    rejected.
