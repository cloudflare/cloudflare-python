      to. Subsequent requests, by the same client to the same load balancer, will be
      sent to the origin server the cookie encodes, for the duration of the cookie
      and as long as the origin server remains healthy. If the cookie has expired or
      the origin server is unhealthy, then a new origin server is calculated and
      used.

      selection is stable and based on the client's ip address.
    - `"header"`: On the first request to a proxied load balancer, a session key
      based on the configured HTTP headers (see
      `session_affinity_attributes.headers`) is generated, encoding the request
      headers used for storing in the load balancer session state which origin the
      request will be forwarded to. Subsequent requests to the load balancer with
      the same headers will be sent to the same origin server, for the duration of

      has been idle for the duration of `session_affinity_ttl` seconds or the origin

      pool using the Cloudflare PoP location for proxied requests or the location
      determined by `location_strategy` for non-proxied requests.
    - `"least_outstanding_requests"`: Select a pool by taking into consideration
      `random_steering` weights, as well as each pool's number of outstanding
      requests. Pools with more pending requests are weighted proportionately less
      relative to others.
    - `"least_connections"`: Select a pool by taking into consideration

      Pools with more open connections are weighted proportionately less relative to
      others. Supported for HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 connections.
