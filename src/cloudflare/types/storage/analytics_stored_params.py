    Filters can be combined using OR and AND boolean logic. AND takes precedence

    OR keyword surrounded by whitespace. The AND operator is defined using a
    semicolon (;) or AND keyword surrounded by whitespace. Note that the semicolon
    is a reserved character in URLs (rfc1738) and needs to be percent-encoded as
    %3B. Comparison options are:
