    A ubiquitous bundle has the highest probability of being verified everywhere,

    Specify the region where your private key can be held locally for optimal TLS

    handshake with the nearest allowed data center. Options allow distribution to
    only to U.S. data centers, only to E.U. data centers, or only to highest
